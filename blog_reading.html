            <h2>Why is consistency so important these days?</h2>

            <p>Because it is one of the keys to success. Or at least, this is what others said about consistency.<br><br>

                <img class="in-blog-image" src="/images/consistency_is_the_key.jpg" target="_blank"><br>

                From my own point of view, I see consistency as one of the most important ingredients if you want to
                build something, launch it and work on it.<br><br>

                It’s easy to create a viral video. It’s easy to write viral articles. But it’s hard to keep every video
                you make a viral one, it’s really hard to be consistent with your articles every time.<br><br>

                I’m not a very disciplined guy but I sometimes found myself working on different projects for weeks,
                months and even years.<br><br>

                That’s how I see how important consistency is.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>1. It develops discipline and autocontrol</strong></h2>

            <p>
                In a world where we need discipline and auto control so we can focus on the things that matter for us,
                consistency is something that can help us get through all of this noise.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Consistency helps us develop a new habit.</h3>

            <p>But if you want to have a really scheduled habit, you need to be disciplined about it. And this
                discipline does not allow you to get off track.<br><br>

                For example, if you want to start a blog and you want to write weekly long-form articles you have to be
                disciplined with yourself. Create a working system that enables you to stay focus, research new ideas,
                write the outline, complete the article, optimize and edit and then publish it. And the next week you
                have to do the same.<br> <br>

                It won’t be easy. But nothing that requires discipline, autocontrol and a lot of work is easy.<br><br>

                And at the end of the day (or in your case, after 6 months of publishing weekly content) you will get
                the results.

            </p>

            <h2><strong>2. Helps build a higher level of trust</strong></h2>

            <p>Showing up every time you promise to will give you a higher level of trust in yourself but also the
                audience will trust you. And this is something I believe we all need – to have a higher level of trust.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Being consistent will help build special moments.</h3>

            <p>Building that special project you are working on every day will give you a level of trust and it will
                also make you feel good about what you are working towards. </p>

            <h2><strong>3. Track your improvement</strong></h2>

            <p>Consistency is not about the results or the finish line. Consistency is about the progress you make every
                time you build that special project.<br><br>

                You can go back and see how you’ve done 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago or yesterday. It’s not about the
                results, it’s about the progress and the process. Analyzing your improvement can help you adjust your
                speed, have an overview of the resource you have and keep a clean and accurate strategy.<br><br>

                <strong>Tracking your improvement will help you build your self-confidence</strong> which will make you
                feel comfortable to set new goals.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>4. It’s helping with your personal position in the crowd</strong></h2>

            <p>Do you want to stand out in the crowd? Be consistent. Do you want to get noticed? Be consistent. Show up
                every time, show up every day.<br><br>

                Create something it’s worth sharing and talking about.<br><br>

                Not everything you put out there will be a viral content. Not everything you will create and publish
                will get you the eyeballs you want and will make people follow you. But <strong>Showing up every day
                    will make people trust you</strong> and maintain their attention. Because these small and simple
                actions carried out repeatedly will be the amount to big results over time.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>5. Connects you with inspiration</strong></h2>

            <p>The consistent work will get you on the track where you can find great ideas for your projects. Working
                consistently will make you stay away from the creativity block.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>With consistency comes inspiration.</h3>

            <p>If you want to write more you don’t have to just stay in front of your computer and start typing. You
                have to develop your research muscle (read more) and write down new ideas (create more) and connect
                these ideas (being creative).<br><br>

                I believe that consistent work will create a state that that connects you with new ideas, new
                inspiration and new ways of creating.<br><br>

                When done right, consistency cultivates creativity.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 0rem;"><strong>How can you develop your consistency
                    skill?</strong></h2>

            <p>With hard work.<br><br>

                That’s it. That’s all you need to know as an answer for this question. It’s just pure hard work.<br><br>

                You can’t buy consistency. You can’t make someone to make you be more consistent with your work.<br><br>

                If you want something, you work for it.<br><br>

                If you want to lose weight, you work for it.<br><br>

                If you want to write a book, you write every day.<br><br>

                If you want to be a professional photographer, you learn about photography, read about photography and
                start shooting.<br><br>

                But if you don’t know where to start, here are a few personal suggestions I can share with you from my
                own point of view. These are my personal ideas, personal suggestions because I experienced them and I
                can say it worked well for me.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>1. Create a work system</strong></h2>

            <p>You have your life and you are the only one who knows what works for you. That’s why you should create
                your own working system. If you are a morning person, then work from this perspective. If you are a
                night owl, then work from this perspective. It doesn’t matter.<br><br>

                You are the only one who knows how to create a great work system for you so you can be consistent with
                what you want to achieve.<br><br>

                For example, I learned during these latest years that my best creative moments are early in the morning.
                That’s why I wake up at 6 o’clock in the morning, drink my coffee, and start creating – write for my
                blog, edit an Instagram Carousel, write other stuff, or just creating – whatever needs to be done. It’s
                the best moment of the entire day. That’s before I start my morning meetings, my daily schedule for
                Creatopy. After that, I have my lunch and then move to the second part of the day – when I don’t have
                the energy to create, so I put the work in the research and connect the ideas part.<br><br>

                But this works for me very well. This working system helped me write hundreds of articles, create tens
                of slides and carousels, work on different content strategies and just manage my entire projects.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Before you start working on your system you have to understand yourself.</h3>

            <p>When is the best time for you to do the work? When is the best time for you to do research? When is the
                best time for you to have meetings or to connect with other people? When is the best time for you to
                collect new ideas?<br><br>

                You are the only one who knows how to create a personal work system.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>2. Set your boundaries</strong></h2>

            <p>These boundaries will help you be consistent with your work. These boundaries will help you achieve your
                goal and help keep you distant from whatever can change your focus from the work you want to be
                done.<br><br>

                For example, if you want to go to the gym and not getting distracted from all your social media
                notifications then don’t bring the phone with you. Write down on a paper all your exercises you want to
                do and put in your pocket. Focus on your work-out. Don’t worry about the time you spend in the gym, I
                bet they have somewhere a watch that can tell you how much you worked-out.<br><br>

                Setting boundaries is another reason why I wake up early in the morning. Because no one can distract me.
                Because there is no activity on social media and nobody calls me that early.<br><br>

                Another thing that helped me set some boundaries was my iPad. For example when I want to write an
                article, I start working on my iPad. I open my Google docs and my Notion where all my ideas are and just
                start typing.<br><br>

                Some boundaries you can set to be more consistent:<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Notifications off while you are working</li>
                    <li>Airplane mode on your phone while you are working</li>
                    <li>Schedule a calendar event for your work</li>
                    <li>Use apps that help you focus on your work</li>
                    <li>Use the Pomodoro technique</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2><strong>3. Plan your habits</strong></h2>

            <p>Plan and build small habits that you can do in your own routine.<br><br>

                Start with small steps and don’t be too drastic with the changes you are inserting in your
                lifestyle.<br><br>

                These small steps can help you achieve your goal, if you are consistent with them.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Be intentional with your habits.</h3>

            <p>Because if you don’t take it seriously, you won’t see the results in days.<br><br>

                Creating a realistic plan to stay on track will help you measure your progress.<br><br>

                That’s why you need to have a plan with your own habit.<br><br>

                If I want to write an article for my blog I will plan before that day one or 2 hours early in the
                morning to work on that blog.<br><br>

                But even before I start working on that specific article I already have some ideas, some plan and some
                outline that I can use to start working with.<br><br>

                Planning is not something you have to pile in your calendar. Planning is when you know when to work and
                when to take a break.<br><br>

                Be intentional with your habit.<br><br>

                Be intentional with your work.<br><br>

                Be intentional with your breaks.<br><br>

                Don’t beat yourself up just because you have some goal to achieve.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>4. Document your progress and your process</strong></h2>

            <p>I always loved the idea to document my work. That’s how I learned a lot of stuff, that’s how I connected
                with a few extraordinary people and it also made me vulnerable in front of my community by showing them
                that I don’t have all the answers.<br><br>

                And to be honest with you, this strategy is not something I came up with. It’s something I first heard
                of from Gary Vaynerchuk and since then I embrace it and use it almost every time in my content
                strategy.<br><br>

                There are 2 ways to document your consistency: progress and process.<br><br>

                What’s the difference:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>documenting your progress</strong> is when you have a personal calendar or plan and you
                        check it every time you do that specific work. For example, I have a personal calendar that I
                        check every day in my 5 minutes morning work-out.</li>
                    
                        <br>

                    <li><strong>documenting your process</strong> is when you create content based on your work and
                        publish it on a platform. For example, you can have an Instagram account and publish a photo or
                        video every time you go to the gym. People can follow your routine, you can inspire them and you
                        can also have a platform to check your process.</li>
                </ul>

                I use both of them because it helps me stay on the track. It’s not something I want to do to just brag.
                It’s something that helps me be more accountable for what I do.<br><br>

                I love what Austin Kleon has done with his calendar. He created a 4-week calendar that you can download
                and print it for free and this can be your work document.<br><br>

                And you can use it either for documenting your progress or documenting your process. It really doesn’t
                matter. Just use it in a way that can help you achieve your personal goal.
            </p>
            
            <h2><strong>5. Improve your habit</strong></h2>

            <p>Let’s say that you set your goal on a project. After that you create a plan to get to that specific goal. And after that you start writing down the steps you have to take to get to that specific goal, following a plan. And these steps are your daily habit you have to take just to get to that specific goal.<br><br>

                But what if I’m telling you that no matter how good your plan is, no matter how big your goal is, if you don’t improve your habit you won’t succeed.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>If your habit is only a routine, you won’t get to the amount of results you want to.</h3>

            <p>You have to improve your habit and change it from a routine into a practice.<br><br>

                <strong></strong>What’s the difference between routine and practice?</strong><br><br>
                
                Routine is when you wake up in the morning and go to your favourite gym, make the same exercises and get back home.<br><br> 
                
                Practice is when you wake up in the morning and you start doing exercises wherever you are. Even if it’s a lockdown and you can’t go to your favourite gym. Even if you are in another city and you have to do those exercises.<br><br>
                
                As Ryan Holiday said “The difference between practice and routine is in the flexibility”<br><br>
                
                Don’t be a foul when you plan your habit and you stick to it even if it’s not working. Don’t be foolish if that plan is not working.<br><br> 
                
                Improve your habit.<br><br> 
                
                One of my favourite routines is to write early in the morning. Since I have 2 kids (one toddler and one 3 months old baby) I have to be flexible with this routine. Even if I woke up early in the morning, make my coffee and sit down at the table, excited to do some writing, there are moments when my wife brings me the 3 months old baby in my room and asks me if I can stay with him, because she had a rough night. I can’t say no. Because my family is more important than my daily routine. So I take care of him, change his clothes, play with him and if he falls asleep I can get back to my writing.<br><br> 
                
                I learned to be more flexible with my routine. I learned to improve my habit.<br><br> 
                
                If my habit was a daily 2 hours writing, now I have a 30 or 40 minutes writing. But guess what? I’m preparing for that writing before I even start writing. How?<br><br>
                
                By writing down the outlines, writing down the sources and just helping me to start writing when I have the amount of time.<br><br> 
            </p>
